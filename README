==============================
Cent Mille Milliards de Poèmes
==============================

This is my personal implementation of Raymon Queneau "Cent mille milliards de
poèmes" (a hundred thousand billions of poems).

What Queneau did was to compose first 10 poems of 14 verses (sonnets) with
equivalent rhymes. Then he "cut" them verse by verse and thus allow people to
compose other poems, by combining verses from the different poems. Since there
are 10 poems of 14 verses each, this means there are 10^14 possible
combinations, hence the title: "Cent mille milliards de poèmes".

This tiny program simply generates a random version of one of these poems. Just
run::

    python queneau.py

and you'll have one.
